## About the Project

GPTDiscordSelfbot is a Discord selfbot powered by the `discord.py-self` library. It responds with GPT-generated responses when pinged, replied to, or messaged directly. The bot is built using the OpenAI Python library for GPT interactions and relies on the `discord.py-self` library for Discord integration. This bot has also `gpt4free` which is a python library that reverse engeniers sites in order to get their chatbot responses.
